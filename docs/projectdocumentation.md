## Problem Statement
Design a modular agentic automation system that takes a small product dataset and automatically generates structured, machine-readable content pages (FAQ, Product Page, Comparison Page). The system must demonstrate clear agent boundaries, reusable content blocks, templates, and JSON outputs.

## Solution Overview
The solution implements a pipeline of stateless agents:
- Parsing Agent
- Question Generation Agent
- Logic Block Agent
- Template Engine Agent
- Page Assembly Agent
- Orchestrator Agent

Each agent has a single responsibility and communicates via explicit inputs/outputs. The template engine merges structured content blocks into JSON templates, producing machine-readable pages.

## Scopes & Assumptions
- No external facts or network calls are used.
- Product B used for comparison is fictional and generated by the orchestrator.
- The only input dataset is the JSON-like product data provided in the assignment.
- Outputs are JSON files in `output/`.

## System Design
### Agent Responsibilities
- **Parsing Agent**: Validate and normalize the input product fields into an internal model.
- **Question Generation Agent**: Algorithmically produces at least 15 categorized questions.
- **Logic Block Agent**: Offers pure functions (summary, benefits, usage, safety, comparisons, faq answers).
- **Template Engine Agent**: Simple placeholder replacement + JSON embedding.
- **Page Assembly Agent**: Builds page JSON objects using templates and blocks.
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Drives the pipeline and writes the final JSON files.

### Orchestration
The pipeline is a DAG:
